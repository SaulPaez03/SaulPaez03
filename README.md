 I'm a Full Stack Developer and an intelectually courious person, therefore I'm always looking for new things to learn. I'm very apassionated about videogames and I'd like to be a Videogames Developer in the future.

I'd describe myself as someone who is comunicative, resilient and collaborative. I'm caracterized by my logical and rasonal thinking, which allows me to find, with some facility, efficient solutions to complex problems.
